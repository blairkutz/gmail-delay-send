# **Welcome to Gmail Delay Send** #

### Why was Gmail Delay Send created? ###
> One of the top 10 requested features in Gmail is the ability to [schedule sending of messages](https://mail.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=suggestions.cs), and with the release of the [Google App Scripts API](http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/) it was finally possible to implement.

### What does it do? ###
> The project allows you to setup a system to create emails and schedule them to be sent at a certain time. You can compose them on any platform (eg. mobile/computer) and the only extra work it to apply a label and specify the time in which to send the mail.

### How do I install? ###
> Follow the steps outlined [here](http://code.google.com/p/gmail-delay-send/wiki/GmailDelaySendInstall_8). There is a one time setup required, but after that you won't need to configure anything else.
