### What has changed from the prior version of Gmail Delay Send (0.7.6) ###

New features:
  * Specify when to send in body of email instead of subject line.
  * New UI - no more spreadsheet
  * 'Bcc me' - emails show up in your sent mail now.
  * bug fixes

Behind the scenes things are very different:
  * Re-written as a [web app](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/execution_web_apps)
  * Ability to version and rollout new [versions](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guide_versions) seamlessly.
  * Use new [UI service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/uiapp)

### Do I have to switch? ###
Nope! If you're happy with the prior version you may continue to use it. Although support will be limited.

### Can I run both? ###
Seems like that would be confusing to me, but you can if you like!

### How do I switch? ###
[Uninstall](https://code.google.com/p/gmail-delay-send/wiki/GmailDelaySendUninstall) old version, [install](https://code.google.com/p/gmail-delay-send/wiki/GmailDelaySendInstall_8) the new one.
