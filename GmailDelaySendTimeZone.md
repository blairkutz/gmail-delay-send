## Setting Time Zone ##

> Although when you create a script through the script editor it should automatically use the time zone your gmail account is synced to, people who copy the existing spreadsheet seems to inherit the original settings. Please follow these steps to correct your time zone:

  * Open the google doc in which you have Gmail Delay Send installed.
  * Open the script editor: `Tools -> Script Editor`
  * Open the properties of the script: `File -> Project Properties`
  * Set the correct time zone.
  * Save and close.

**NOTE**: If you do change timezones you will need to update this setting!
